# Scrimba Solo Project - Restaurant Ordering App

### Deployed to:
https://curious-naiad-f679be.netlify.app/

## Requirements:
+ ~~Follow the Figma design spec~~
+ ~~Render the three menu options using JS~~
+ ~~Be able to add/remove items~~
+ ~~Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs~~

## Stretch Goals: 

- ~~Change the theme~~
  - ~~Do not change the design spec where possible!~~
- Offer a 'meal deal' discount (bundle)
- Allow users to rate from 0 to 5 after order
- Timer and/or map


## Thought Exercise

What are the current flaws:
+ The emojis are different on each system
+ Ordering more than one of an item appends it to the end instead of adding multiples
  + Add number under + mark for current qty
+ I don't like the dark mode box shadow. You can see the lines.
+ CC card number currently uses min and max. Should use pattern instead with custom message?
  + Same for CCV. We need custom validation.
+ There is no way to start a new order. 
+ ~~Can't close modal...~~
